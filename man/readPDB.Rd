\usage{
readPDB(file = system.file("protseq/4HHB.pdb", package = "Rcpi"))
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The name of the file which the sequences in PDB format are
              to be read from. If it does not contain an absolute or
              relative path, the file name is relative to the current
              working directory, \code{\link{getwd}}.
              The default here is to read the \code{4HHB.PDB} file which
              is present in the \code{protseq} directory of the protr package.}
}
\value{
A character vector, representing the amino acid sequence
        of the single-letter code.
