Title: Protein Sequence Descriptor Calculation and Similarity Computation with R
Description: The protr package focus on offering a unique and comprehensive
    toolkit for protein sequence descriptor calculation and similarity
    computation. The descriptors included in the protr package are extensively
    utilized in Bioinformatics and Chemogenomics research. The qualitative
    descriptors listed in protr include Amino Acid Composition (Amino Acid
    Composition/Dipeptide Composition/Tripeptide Composition) descriptor,
    Autocorrelation (Normalized Moreau-Broto Autocorrelation/Moran
    Autocorrelation/Geary Autocorrelation) descriptor, CTD
    (Composition/Transition/Distribution) descriptor, Conjoint Traid
    descriptor, Quasi-sequence Order (Sequence Order Coupling
    Number/Quasi-sequence Order Descriptors) descriptor and Pseudo Amino Acid
    Composition (Pseudo Amino Acid Composition/Amphiphilic Pseudo Amino Acid
    Composition) descriptor. The quantitative descriptors, for
    Proteochemometric (PCM) Modeling, includes the Generalized Scales-Based
    Descriptors derived by Principal Components Analysis, Generalized
    Scales-Based Descriptors derived by AA-Properties (AAindex), Generalized
    Scales-Based Descriptors derived by 20+ classes of 2D and 3D Molecular
    Descriptors (Topological, WHIM, VHSE, etc.), Generalized Scales-Based
    Descriptors derived by Factor Analysis, Generalized Scales-Based
    Descriptors derived by Multidimensional Scaling, and Generalized BLOSUM/PAM
    Matrix-Derived Descriptors. The protr package also integrates the
    functionality of parallellized similarity computation derived by protein
    sequence alignment and Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity measures
    between a list of protein sequences / GO terms / Entrez Gene IDs. ProtrWeb,
    the web service built on protr, is located at:
    http://cbdd.csu.edu.cn:8080/protrweb/ . The protr package is developed by
    Computational Biology and Drug Design (CBDD) Group, Central South
    University.
